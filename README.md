# Arduino GPS Tracker and Receiver
> Track satellites as well as your GPS position and analyze the NMEA sentences.

In this project, we implemented on an Arduino Pro Mini a GPS Satellites Tracker as well as a GPS Receiver with the library TinyGPS++. We then analyze the NMEA sentences to draw graphs in MATLAB. We also calculated the GPS transmitter accuracy.
